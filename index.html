    <p>Indian classical music is one of the oldest and most sophisticated musical traditions in the world, with roots stretching back thousands of years. Deeply intertwined with Indiaâ€™s cultural, spiritual, and philosophical heritage, it is based on a highly developed system of ragas (melodic frameworks) and talas (rhythmic cycles) that guide both composition and improvisation. The tradition is broadly divided into two major styles: Hindustani music of North India, influenced by Persian and Mughal elements, and Carnatic music of South India, which has preserved more of the ancient devotional and temple-based practices. Indian classical music is not merely for entertainment; it is seen as a means of emotional expression, meditation, and spiritual elevation. Performances often involve deep interaction between the vocalist or instrumentalist and accompanying artists, such as the tabla or mridangam player, and can evolve into long, intricate improvisations. Passed down through generations via the guru-shishya parampara (teacher-disciple tradition), this art form continues to flourish, adapting to modern platforms while retaining its timeless essence.</p>
